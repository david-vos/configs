# My Configs

This repo holds my personal configuration files for tools I use daily. I'm starting my ricing journey, so expect updates as I tweak and refine my setup.

## Setup
---
- **Laptop**: MacBook Pro (M3 Pro)  
- **Editor**: IntelliJ (with vim keybindings)  
- **Terminal**: Ghostty (used to use Alacritty)  
- **Shell**: zsh  

## Contents
---
- `editor/`: IntelliJ keymaps and configs  --> One day I will create these
- `terminal/`: Ghostty profiles and settings  
- `shell/`: `.zshrc`, aliases, and scripts  
- `ricing/`: UI tweaks and experiments  

## Notes

Still figuring things outâ€”suggestions welcome.
