# --- Display-Specific Padding & External Bar (Hardcoded IDs) ---

# IMPORTANT: Ensure these Display IDs (1 and 2) consistently match your monitors.
# You can check with 'yabai -m query --displays' after connecting your monitors.

# --- Configuration for MacBook Built-in Display (ID 1) ---
# (Based on your 'w:1800' query output)
# Adjust these values until your MacBook display looks correct.
# top_padding 0 and external_bar all:30:0 is a good starting point for the MacBook.
# This assumes the 30px covers the macOS menubar + a little extra gap.
yabai -m config --display 1 top_padding 5
yabai -m config --display 1 external_bar all:44:0


# --- Configuration for External Monitor (ID 2) ---
# (Based on your 'w:1920' query output)
# This assumes you want a total of 40px space at the top.
# You can set top_padding to 0 if external_bar should handle all 44px.
yabai -m config --display 2 top_padding 5
yabai -m config --display 2 external_bar all:44:0


# --- Event Signal to Re-apply on Display Change ---

# This is still necessary! When displays change, yabai needs to know to re-read
# these display-specific settings for the active monitors.
# This will execute the entire yabairc again, effectively reapplying the
# relevant display config commands for currently connected displays.
yabai -m signal --remove event=display_change
yabai -m signal --add event=display_change action="source ~/.config/yabai/yabairc"
